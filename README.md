Link to project: https://void-simple-api-two.netlify.app/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cooking data Api!


An application that allows the user to type in an ingredient and get a link to a youtube video that utilizes that ingredient.

Optimizations:

I had a blast making this one. I was really excited when I saw that the return object included a link to video media. 
This was the first time I was able to incorporate that media format into a website Ive built! 
I think this was the moment I really fell in love with APis (well, USEING them at least, finding a working one is another story...)
